# World Engine — Project Instructions

## What this is

A local, single-player-first engine for running a persistent RPG world. A creator keeps structural control over how the world evolves. Two modes of play feed the same world: asynchronous **pass-plays** and real-time **live sessions** (a player enters a location, sees the NPCs present, talks to them, learns things, builds relationships).

Full context lives in:
- `world-engine-schema.md` — the authoritative database schema.
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` — the design decisions and the v1 scope.

Read both before making any structural change.

## Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Web:** FastAPI
- **ORM / DB:** SQLModel over SQLite (Supabase/PostgreSQL-compatible later)
- **UI:** two modes — server-rendered HTML with HTMX for the player-facing app
  (not yet built); single-page HTML + vanilla `fetch()` for the creator cockpit
  (no framework, no CDN, no build step, works fully offline).
- **Local models:** Ollama. Current target model: `huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:8b-v2` (see Local model notes below).

## Working rules

- Work in small, scoped steps. Do **only** what the current task asks. Do not anticipate or build future steps unprompted — if a next step seems useful, suggest it and stop.
- The database schema is authoritative. Match `world-engine-schema.md` exactly: same tables, columns, types, defaults, and foreign keys.
- **Creator control is structural.** Nothing mutates world state without passing through `proposed_mutation` and explicit creator approval. Dialogue is free; its consequences are not.
- **Injected context depends on the active role, never the account.** In player mode, never expose an NPC's secrets, others' secrets, or anything the player character is not meant to know.
- Keep the database engine URL in an environment variable (default to a local SQLite file) so switching to PostgreSQL/Supabase needs no code change.
- History is sacred: prefer preserving successive states over overwriting them.
- **`--force` only deletes `proposed` rows.** Any `proposed_mutation` row with
  status `applied`, `approved`, or `rejected` is reviewed history and must never
  be deleted — not by the CLI `--force` flag, not by the cockpit re-analyze
  endpoint. A forced re-analysis regenerates proposals alongside existing
  reviewed rows.
- **Language convention:** design conversation happens in French; all code,
  schema, comments, commit messages, and documentation are in English.
- **Step closure:** every closed step updates the schema changelog (if
  schema-touching) and keeps `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` and this file
  consistent with the code. Use the `/close-step` command.

## Invariants (verified at every review)

- **Per-NPC uniqueness:** each present NPC belongs to exactly ONE open
  gathering. The invariant is per-NPC, NOT per-location (multiple open
  gatherings in one location are legal). Defended on every join/migrate path.
- **Dissolve-before-create lives in the caller** (`enter_location`), never
  inside `generate_gatherings` — preserves the multiplayer upgrade path.
- **`relation_change` is an accumulating type:** never deduplicated across
  turns, owned exclusively by per-turn analysis (`local_ai_immediate`); the
  final pass filters it out.
- **`new_knowledge` / `status_change` are idempotent facts:** identity-based
  dedup (`entity_id` + `subject`; `entity_id`), same conversation required.
- **Secrets are structurally excluded** from every assembled context — never
  "guarded by instruction". `character.secrets` is creator meta-narrative
  (notes ABOUT the character: true nature, planned arcs) and is NEVER read
  by any context assembler. What an NPC knows-but-conceals lives in
  `knowledge` rows with `is_secret = TRUE`, excluded by the assembler. This
  exclusion extends to every propagation path, not just context assembly:
  `analyze_overhearing` (Tier 4) never sources a proposal from a
  `knowledge` row with `is_secret = TRUE`.
- **`entity_a_id` in gathering analysis** comes from the analyzed NPC line's
  `speaker_id`, never from `conv.npc_id` (legacy single-NPC fallback only).
- **Two sanctioned canon-write paths, no others:** `_apply_mutation` (AI
  proposals, after creator approval) and the creator CRUD (direct creator
  authority). No code path may ever write canon in response to an AI
  proposal outside `_apply_mutation`.
- **History is sacred on BOTH write paths:** any edit to `relation` or
  `knowledge` (either write path — `_apply_mutation` or creator CRUD)
  appends the previous state to `change_history`; states are preserved,
  never silently overwritten.
- **Commit before touching any canon-writing path** (`_apply_mutation`, the
  creator CRUD, the analyzers, and everything they call) — a hard invariant.
  Recommended (not hard): also commit before touching the `/say` flow or the
  interpretation phase — playability-critical. (Between BRIEF-07 and
  BRIEF-08/D2a.1, the interpretation phase was itself a mutation producer via
  auto-applied `item_update`; that producer is now removed, but the
  recommendation stands on playability alone.)
- **The MJ context assembler is scoped to the player's perception
  boundary:** only what the player may perceive (current location, public
  co-presents, public/confirmed events) or already knows (the player
  character's own knowledge). Never NPC-private knowledge, secrets,
  internal names, non-public entities, or invisible relations. Enforced
  by query construction, never by instruction.
- **Knowledge levels never decrease through the mutation pipeline:** the
  ladder `unaware < rumor < suspicious < partial < knows <
  fully_understands` is monotone for every `knowledge_change` proposal and
  apply — both at detection (overhearing upgrades, direct affirmation) and
  at apply time (`_apply_mutation`'s "level already >= proposed" guard).
  `fully_understands` is never granted via any conversational path
  (structurally capped at `knows`); downgrades, forgetting, and
  `is_incorrect` correction are creator CRUD only.

## Local model notes

Target local model for NPC dialogue and analysis: **`huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:8b-v2`**, run via Ollama. Relevant when wiring the model (not before — context assembly is model-agnostic):

- **Abliterated** = refusal mechanisms removed. Will not refuse, and is generally more compliant to *any* instruction — including a player pushing it to reveal. This makes it the strictest possible test of the "concealed knowledge / under guard" mechanism: if secrets hold here, they hold anywhere. The creator checkpoint remains the real safety net regardless.
- **Thinking mode:** Qwen3 emits a `<think>...</think>` reasoning block before its answer. `ollama_client.strip_think()` handles this robustly (complete block, unclosed tag, orphan closing tag). Three policies apply depending on the call site:
  - **NPC dialogue** (`talk.py` CLI): disable thinking with `/no_think` in the user message — deterministic, faster, and the reasoning block must never reach the player.
  - **NPC dialogue** (cockpit `/say`, NPC phase): `chat_stream` with the built-in `_StreamThinkFilter` — thinking is left enabled, the filter suppresses the block before any token is yielded. The NPC reply is buffered internally; the player never sees it raw.
  - **MJ narration** (cockpit `/say`, MJ phase): `chat_stream` + `/no_think` appended to the user message — same filter as a backstop, `/no_think` for speed. What streams to the player is narration prose only.
  - **MJ interpretation** (cockpit `/say`, phase 0): `chat()` non-streaming + `/no_think` + `format="json"`. Classifies the player's input into `dialogue` / `npc_reaction` / `scene`. Fallback to `dialogue` on any error — a misclassification must never break a turn.
  - **NPC initiative vote** (cockpit `/say`, Tier 3 C1): `chat()` non-streaming + `format="json"` + `/no_think` — same policy as MJ interpretation. Failure is silent (initiative simply doesn't fire).
  - **NPC initiative act** (cockpit `/say`, Tier 3 C2): `chat()` non-streaming + `format="json"`, **no** `/no_think` — the JSON schema already constrains output, and leaving thinking on helps the small model follow the two-field contract (`act_text`, `move`). Falls back to `_NPC_INITIATIVE_ACT_FALLBACK` if `pt-npc-initiative-act` isn't seeded; any error → silent skip.
  - **Conversation analysis** (`analyze_conversation.py`, `analyzer.py`): leave thinking enabled — the reasoning helps the model follow format instructions; `strip_think` removes the block before JSON parsing.
- **French quality:** multilingual but not Mistral-grade idiomatic French. Acceptable for validating logic; if narrative quality disappoints, that's a model-selection signal, not a code defect.

```

`src` layout: the package lives under `src/world_engine`. Scripts in `scripts/`
prepend `src` to `sys.path`, so they run without an editable install.

### Naming

- **Tables:** every model sets `__tablename__` explicitly to the exact schema
  name (`pass_play`, `conversation_message`, `proposed_mutation`, …). Class
  names are PascalCase (`PassPlay`, `ConversationMessage`).
- **Primary keys:** TEXT/UUID strings. Top-level tables auto-generate via a
  `_uuid()` `default_factory`; entity-extension tables (`character`, `location`,
  `faction`, `artifact`) take their PK as the `entity.id` foreign key.
- **Reserved name:** `entity.metadata` maps to the Python attribute `metadata_`
  (SQLAlchemy reserves `metadata`).

### Schema fidelity rules

- DB-level `DEFAULT` clauses are preserved with `server_default` so the generated
  DDL matches the schema; Python-side defaults keep the ORM ergonomic.
- Columns that carry a default are also `NOT NULL` (a value is always present) —
  a deliberate strengthening over the literal SQL.
- JSON columns use SQLAlchemy `JSON` (becomes `JSONB` on PostgreSQL).
- Foreign keys are declared on every column the schema references; SQLite FK
  enforcement is turned on via a `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` connect listener.

### How to run / test

- **Install:** `python -m venv .venv`, activate, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Database URL:** from `WORLD_ENGINE_DATABASE_URL` (defaults to
  `sqlite:///world_engine.db`). Switching to PostgreSQL/Supabase changes only
  this variable, never code.
- **Initialize the DB:** `python scripts/init_db.py` — idempotent; prints the
  tables and index counts it created.
- **Seed pilot data:** `python scripts/seed_pilot.py` — inserts Verkhaal world,
  NPCs, relations, knowledge, and prompt templates. Idempotent.
- **Live conversation:** `python scripts/talk.py` — opens a terminal conversation
  with Maelis. Requires Ollama running (`ollama serve`).
- **Analyse a conversation:** `python scripts/analyze_conversation.py <conversation_id>`
  — reads the closed transcript, calls Ollama locally, writes `proposed_mutation`
  rows. Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing; `--force` to replace existing
  *proposed* rows and re-run (reviewed rows are never deleted — see Working rules).
- **Creator cockpit:** `python scripts/cockpit.py` — starts the local review UI
  at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Select an NPC → Start → play turns live. Each turn:
  NPC reply is generated internally (buffered), MJ narration is streamed to the
  player; both are persisted (`speaker='npc'` canonical, `speaker='mj'`
  presentation). Raw NPC line appears as a muted annotation for creator audit.
  Per-turn `proposed_mutation` rows (`proposed_by='local_ai_immediate'`) are
  written silently after each turn. Use **Analyze** to run the final pass (which
  filters `relation_change` and deduplicates against the per-turn flags). Approve
  / reject proposals in the queue individually, or select several `proposed`
  rows via checkboxes and use **Approve selected** / **Reject selected**
  (`POST /api/mutations/batch-review`) — sequential, per row, through the same
  `_apply_mutation` / unit-reject paths; stale or already-reviewed rows are
  skipped. Binds to loopback only. Requires Ollama for
  all AI calls (NPC, MJ, analysis). The scene view's **Voyager** control
  (`POST /api/travel`) lets the creator move the player to any location: a
  silent, clean transition (closes the open conversation and the player's
  gathering membership, then updates `current_location_id`); the existing
  scene-entry flow generates the new location's gatherings on next entry.
- **Re-seeding prompts:** `python scripts/seed_pilot.py` uses `upsert_prompt_template`
  for `pt-mj-narration`, `pt-mj-interpretation`, `pt-mj-gathering`, `pt-mj-speaker`,
  `pt-mj-initiative`, and `pt-npc-initiative-act` — re-running the seed converges
  the DB to the latest wording without losing other data.
