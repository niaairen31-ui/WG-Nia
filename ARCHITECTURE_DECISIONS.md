# WORLD ENGINE — Architecture Decisions

*Companion to the schema and founding document. Records the decisions made before building. This file is the brief for Claude Code.*

## CONTEXT

The engine runs a persistent RPG world. The creator keeps structural control over how the world evolves. Two modes of play feed the same world:

- **Pass-plays** — actions players declare asynchronously between sessions.
- **Live sessions** — real-time play where a player acts as if inside the story (enters a location, sees the NPCs present, talks to them, learns things, builds relationships).

Local AI models (Llama, GLM) drive analysis and NPC dialogue. The creator controls every master prompt to set the limits and keep control.

---

## CORE DECISION — Free dialogue, controlled consequences

The founding principle is "creator control is structural" (approval checkpoints). Live conversation makes per-line approval impossible, so we split interaction into two layers with different risk levels:

- **Dialogue** (talking, learning, feeling out an NPC) — low risk, runs autonomously in real time. The NPC speaks freely, but only within the bounds of what it knows.
- **World mutations** (a relationship evolving, a secret revealed, knowledge acquired, an event created) — these pass through a checkpoint. Not the conversation itself, but its *consequences* on world state.

During a conversation the local AI plays the NPC **and** proposes mutations (e.g. "player gained Marek's trust → relation +2", "Marek hinted the Council is hiding something → new knowledge"). The player plays without friction; proposals accumulate. The creator validates them later, at the checkpoint.

**Why this works:** even if a local model drifts or an NPC says something off, it cannot change world state without creator approval. Worst case stays recoverable. The same validation pipeline serves both pass-plays and live sessions — one mutation pipeline, one source of truth.

---

## SCHEMA ADJUSTMENTS

Three additions. Not a rewrite — the existing schema holds.

### 1. Live conversations

Store the raw player ↔ NPC exchanges. The transcript is the raw material the AI later analyzes to propose mutations.

- `conversation` — who talks to whom, in which location, during which session.
- `conversation_message` — each line (player or NPC), in order.

### 2. Proposed mutations as a first-class concept

Currently `pass_play` blends the declared action and its `local_proposal`. We extract a generic `proposed_mutation` table describing **one atomic change** (relation delta, new knowledge, event creation, status change, etc.) with its approval status.

Both pass-plays and live conversations produce `proposed_mutation` rows. This gives a single validation pipeline regardless of source — the thing that makes the engine coherent.

### 3. Context assembly (logic, not a table)

When a player talks to an NPC, the engine builds that NPC's prompt: who it is, what it knows (`knowledge`), its relations to the interlocutor, and its secrets to **never** reveal. The schema already holds all of this. The missing piece is a function: "assemble an NPC's context for a conversation." This is where real creator control lives — inject only what the NPC knows, never its secrets nor others'.

## V1 SCOPE — Minimal playable

Goal: find out fast whether the local models can hold a character. That is the project's real unknown.

**In scope:**
- One player, one location, a few NPCs.
- A live conversation that runs with correctly injected NPC context.
- Mutations accumulate as proposals — **not yet applied** to the world.
- Local web app, running locally.
- **Role toggle.** The single test user switches between creator mode and player mode. The rule: injected context depends on the *active role*, not the account. In creator mode the user sees real world state (secrets included), edits, and reviews mutations. In player mode the app injects only what the player character is meant to know — secrets are hidden from view even though the same human knows them. This makes solo testing more honest and is the exact mechanism multiplayer will reuse later (a real player just gets their own account, locked to player mode).

**Out of scope for v1 (but kept easy to add later):**
- The checkpoint validation UI and real application of mutations to world state.
- Multiplayer / real concurrent players (solo testing first).
- The neighbouring nation and wider lore expansion.
- Migration to Supabase (stay on SQLite).

The minimal version tells us in a few days whether the dialogue "holds" before building the rest of the loop.

---

## DESIGN CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FORWARD

- SQLite now, Supabase-compatible later (UUID text PKs, JSON → JSONB). Only env vars change, not app code.
- History is sacred — nothing overwritten; successive states preserved.
- Creator owns and edits every master prompt.
- Everything is an entity; magic is an actor.
